The progress explained below will be included at my [personal repository](https://github.com/DiscreteVic/AnaloguePocketDev).

### First steps 

- Development documentation: [Getting Started](https://www.analogue.co/developer/docs/getting-started)(Referenced as 1) & [Packaging a Core](https://www.analogue.co/developer/docs/packaging-a-core)(Reference as 2).

- Core template: Using as base project the [template](https://github.com/open-fpga/core-template) provided by analogue.

## Day 1: [30/10/2023]

### Getting development enviroment

- The first step is to build the template core[1]:
Load Quartus Prime Lite Edition 22.1 and open proyect (src/fpga/ap_core.qpf), upgrade automatically. Then Compile.

Analogue provides valuable information about the output files generated by quartus (src/fpga/output_files):
![Bitstream Formats by Analogue](/assets/analoguebitstreamformats.png)

Created the generation of the bitstream reverse, and the project structure to pack the core following the Analogue guide [2].

## Day 2: [2/11/2023]

### Setting up and configuration of development enviroment

- Included makefiles to build the quartus project without IDE (by CLI).
