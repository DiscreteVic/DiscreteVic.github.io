### Researching

- The first step is to look for any kind of documentation and information about the Serial Port 1 and the broadband adapter (BBA).

As cover page the GCForever Wiki (https://www.gc-forever.com/wiki/) gives a few, but important, information about the BBA, as the PCB pictures with the reference of the two ICs (MX98730EC  and  TDK TLA-6T118). Later, after some help (by Extrems user at webhdx discord) I have found a datasheet of a similar IC to the MX98730EC. That IC works as a converter from a (kind of) SPI to Ethernet.
