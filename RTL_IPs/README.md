Page where the development of the RTL IPs are located. 

## Setup:

The RTL IPs are developed in VHDL (most of cases), and they are syntetized and implemented over the DE10-Lite Board with a Altera MAX 10 FPGA.

The proyects are build with [Intel® Quartus® Prime Lite Edition](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/795188/intel-quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-23-1-for-windows.html)
