### Building a Datapath - Register File

- Following the book mentioned above, the first part is build the data path, in a single cycle mode (the pipeline will come after). And the first part of the Data path is the register file ([commit](https://github.com/DiscreteVic/RISC-V-minimal-core/commit/1b87704ab9d8966ae78004c4da8fd2f958c1b25d)). Just implemented, not tested.
